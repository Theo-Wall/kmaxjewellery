              The process to creating in any art form is both intuitive and
              experimental. Creating small scale sculpture for decorative,
              functional, or wearable purposes is my intention. As a maker, I am
              passionate about materials, creating my own designs, problem
              solving, and expressing these ideas by constructing one-of-a-kind
              objects.

              A variety of environments influence my designs. I capture the
              negative space shapes between tree branches by creating pendants
              or brooches. Bird motifs have appeared in my magpie-etched cuff
              bracelets, anodized aluminum pins and earrings, and hoop
              necklaces. I am also influenced by my farming roots, travel, and
              historical periods including my European, Scottish, and MÃ©tis
              ancestry. My other influences are conceived from periods I have
              studied in Art History such as the Baroque, Victorian and
              Contemporary eras.

              My work is divided into three distinct lines: contemporary,
              historical, and Canadiana. The contemporary line consists of a
              pendant style called Just Jasper and uses plexi-glass as a base
              for the Jasper stone with a sterling silver pierced bezel. The
              historical line of Victorian brooches with a bezel-set Labradorite
              stone is a re-design from images of antique cabinet drawer back
              plates. The Canadiana line is cast snow called Canadian Snow Cast,
              eh! and consists of Glacialis I and II neck pieces and Snow Drop
              pendants.
